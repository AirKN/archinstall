# Arch Install
Arch install script, customized to my preferences and settings

## How to use
```
curl -LO raw.githubusercontent.com/airkn/archinstall/main/archinstall.sh
chmod +x archinstall.sh
sh archinstall.sh
```
this is good enough for now, i might upload it somewhere else in the future to have a shorter link
